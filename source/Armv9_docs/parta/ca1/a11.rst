A1.1 About the Arm architecture
========================================

    reference

The Arm architecture described in this Architecture Reference Manual defines the behavior of an abstract machine, 
referred to as a processing element, often abbreviated to PE. Implementations compliant with the Arm architecture 
must conform to the described behavior of the processing element. It is not intended to describe how to build an 
implementation of the PE, nor to limit the scope of such implementations beyond the defined behaviors.

Except where the architecture specifies differently, the programmer-visible behavior of an implementation that is 
compliant with the Arm architecture must be the same as a simple sequential execution of the program on the 
processing element. This programmer-visible behavior does not include the execution time of the program.
